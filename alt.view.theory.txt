Matt McDonald (mkmcdonald):
I think of the model layer as the pantry, full of recipes (domain logic) and ingredients.

Requests are orders,
a Web server is an order printer, and
responses are completed orders.

Controllers are cooks using domain logic (model layer) to create a response to send out.
Views are the plating style.
Frameworks and libraries would be special tools like blenders and pressure cookers.
