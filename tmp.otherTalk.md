Maintaining "the Zone" and Mitigating Zone Crashes

Being productive is all about being in the zone. There are many distractions from that goal, both internal and external. This talk will give you several tips and tricks of the trade to avoid those distractions that are avoidable and tactics to mitigate the effects of those that are unavoidable.

Some of the concepts Sean will touch on include: remote working, co-working, office hours, meeting schedules, the fear of success and the fear of failure.

This isn't a PHP specific talk! 

I've given versions of this talk at multiple area User Groups, as an UnCon at SunshinePHP 2014 and as regular session at php[tek] 2013. Formerly titled _&lt;?php echo 'Hello worl...Ooh Shiny_ -- which I can keep if you prefer it.
