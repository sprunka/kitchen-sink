Sean Prunka has been developing web sites and applications for the better part of 16 years. He got his start at Rosetta Stone, designing and developing a now-extinct CMS-style reseller portal. From there he did some freelance stuff and worked with a nondescript PHP farm. Currently he works as a Senior PHP Engineer (and is learning Node and Angular)in Reston, VA and previously for MAD Security and Battelle Memorial Institute in Charlottesville, VA. While at Battelle he designed and developed several customized extensions for MediaWiki wikis for the Intelligence Community. This means that while you can ask about them, he can't tell you. (Not completely true, nor completely false.)
